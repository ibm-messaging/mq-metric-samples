# This script builds and runs a container with the designated metrics collector.
# It uses buildah+podman as an alternative approach to the Dockerfile mechanism shown
# elsewhere in this repository. It also uses the Red Hat Universal Base Images as
# the starting points.
#
# We first build the collector using a full-fat image. And then copy the compiled
# code to a slimmer container which can then be deployed. This script uses
# a combination of the supplied sample configuration file and some environment
# variables. You might prefer to keep the config file outside of the running container
# and just mount it into the system.
